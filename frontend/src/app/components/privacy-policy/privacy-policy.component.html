    <div class="text-left">

      <p *ngIf="officialMempoolSpace">The <a href="https://mempool.space/">mempool.space</a> website, the <a href="https://liquid.network/">liquid.network</a> website, their associated API services, and related network and server infrastructure (collectively, the "Website") are operated by Mempool Space K.K. in Japan ("Mempool", "We", or "Us") and self-hosted from <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/142052#connectivity">AS142052</a>.</p>

      <p *ngIf="!officialMempoolSpace">This website and its API service (collectively, the "Website") are operated by a member of the Bitcoin community ("We" or "Us"). Mempool Space K.K. in Japan ("Mempool") has no affiliation with the operator of this Website, and does not sponsor or endorse the information provided herein.</p>

      <h5>By accessing this Website, you agree to the following Privacy Policy:</h5>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES ARE SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>Out of respect for the Bitcoin community, this website does not use any third-party analytics, third-party trackers, or third-party cookies, and we do not share any private user data with third-parties. Additionally, to mitigate the risk of surveillance by malicious third-parties, we self-host this website on our own hardware and network infrastructure, so there are no "hosting companies" or "cloud providers" involved with the operation of this website.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED FIRST PARTIES ARE ALSO SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>Out of respect for the Bitcoin community, this website does not use any first-party cookies, except to store your preferred language setting (if any). However, we do use minimal first-party analytics and logging as needed for the operation of this website, as follows:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>We use basic webserver logging (nginx) for sysadmin purposes, which collects your IP address along with the requests you make. These logs are deleted after 10 days, and we do not share this data with any third-party. To conceal your IP address from our webserver logs, we recommend that you use Tor Browser with our Tor v3 hidden service onion hostname.</li>

        <br>

        <li>We use a self-hosted statistics application (matomo) for analytics purposes, which collects your IP address along with the requests you make. Our matomo instance is configured to respect your privacy by redacting your IP address and other methods, and we do not share this data with any third-party. To conceal your activity from our analytics, we recommend that you use a privacy protecting browser extension that blocks matomo from being loaded.</li>

      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUST YOUR OWN SELF-HOSTED MEMPOOL EXPLORER</h4>

      <p>For maximum privacy, we recommend that you use your own self-hosted instance of The Mempool Open Source Project&reg; on your own hardware. You can easily install your own self-hosted instance of this website on a Raspberry Pi using a one-click installation method maintained by various Bitcoin fullnode distributions such as Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, MyNode, and RoninDojo. See our project's GitHub page for more details about self-hosting this website.</p>
